# Run with Windows using binary files \(.exe\)



{% hint style="info" %}
#### The validator client is currently not working - requires a [fix](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/issues/5456#issue-601128068) by PrysmaticLabs. 

#### Please use the [Docker tutorial](https://kb.beaconcha.in/tutorial-eth2-multiclient/docker-beaconnode-and-validator) instead.
{% endhint %}

**Step 0.**

Open the [Prysmatic Participation Page](https://prylabs.net/participate) and the [client release page](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/releases)**.**

**Step 1.**

Open a [Command Prompt](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-the-Command-Prompt-in-Windows) window and enter the following: 

`reg add HKCU\Console /v VirtualTerminalLevel /t REG_DWORD /d 1`

{% hint style="info" %}
**This is not required. This command fixes the cosmetics of the command prompt**.
{% endhint %}

**Step 2.**

**Download** the newest versions of the beaconnode **and** validator clients. The version names might have changed already, but the file name should be the same \(green mark\).

**Step 3.**

Find the files that have been downloaded. Usually located in the "Downloads" folder.  
  
Open the beaconchain file  "**beacon-chain**-v1.0.0-alpha.2-windows-amd64.exe".   
A **warning** should appear. **Click** on "More Info" and then "Run anyway".

1. **If this does not work**, you can also open a command prompt window and drag & drop the beaconchain file into it and press enter.
2. **If you get the following error,** `The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process`,  you will need to delete the file "beaconchain.db" **manually**.
